# Twisted Insurrection Updated Client
Since the original authors have abandoned support for the mod by not updating the game, I decided to update the client configs so that the client can be updated with the latest chips that the community is developing.

Main features/improvements:

* Updated client to the latest release;
* Restored Discord app id;
* Add Russian language via client's L10N;
* Fixed campaign selector window for individual mission selection.

## Installation
0. Download repository files
1. Delete `Resources\Binaries` folder in your local mod folder
2. Drop repository files to the mod folder and accept file replacing
3. Launch `TILauncher.exe`
4. ???
5. Profit!
